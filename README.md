# Jenny Vivar Labs
 This is my lab homework.
For lab one I made a main scene where a mother rabbit and her baby are sitting idly by while a wolf spots them and decides to hunt them. 
In the second scene, I put several trees in a forest where a single rabbit is peacefully relaxing.
For this lab I learned that saving images from the web onto my file folder is easier to do once everything is organized in one folder.
I tend to not keep files organized so having files for my labs helps me keep track of them easily.
